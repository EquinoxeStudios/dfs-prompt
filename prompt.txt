Generate the html code for a daily fantasy sports website. The website must adhere to the online non-casino games policy of Google Ads and must be compliant with it.

Generate an unique framework for the site - so it's an unique, modern site.

Include some of the next ideas to ensure that the site generated is unique :

Vary DOM tree depth, randomizing classes and ID names, having different markup styles (use semantic tags like <article>, <aside> and other times use generic <div> etc
Then u can use different dynamic inline styles - small inline style tweaks: padding: 12px vs. padding: 12.3px, unique CSS variables,
use external stylesheets for some builds, and inline <style> blocks or CSS-in-JS for others, different web-safe fonts, different content copy, varied <title> formats (“SuperSlot Casino – Play Free” vs. “Free Casino Games at SuperSlot”) and meta descriptions etc, serve the same image under different filenames and formats, use different JSON-LD schemas.

Each url must have a canonical url for SEO purposes.

Also generate the sitemap.xml

Use the next site outline :
