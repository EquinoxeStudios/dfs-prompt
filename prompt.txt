# Generate Visually Stunning Daily Fantasy Sports Website

**CRITICAL UNIQUENESS INSTRUCTION**: Each time you generate this website, it MUST be completely unique. Before starting, mentally "roll dice" to randomly select options from each category below. Never generate the same combination twice.

## Randomization Strategy
1. For each "RANDOMLY CHOOSE" instruction, select a different option than previous generations
2. Vary numerical values by at least 15-30% each time
3. Use different combinations of features (never repeat the same set)
4. Generate unique class names using random prefixes/suffixes
5. Apply different animation timings, easing functions, and sequences

Create a visually striking, modern daily fantasy sports (DFS) informational website that adheres to Google Ads' online non-casino games policy and is fully compliant.
